# Hey, I'm Douglas! ðŸ‘‹

I've been working professionally in programming since 2021, but my passion began when I was 14 years old, creating Discord bots and websites for my friends and myself.

My motivation is to create products that creates value and keep up with the advancement of new technologies. I enjoy contributing to projects that improve people's lives.

Regarding my personal and professional interests, I read books on various topics; my favorite author is Julio RamÃ³n Ribeyro. I also try to attend cultural and tech events in my city. Professionally, I spend a significant part of my day integrating and improving features at work and developing my personal projects.
